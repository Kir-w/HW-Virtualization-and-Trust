### Hardware Abstract Layer project in Rust

### Group with Ariane ODONI, Ma√Øa ROCA, Kylie WU (OCC3)

**First feature (October) : the GPIO feature**  

It abstracts the Atmega328p (Arduino Uno).  
The code should allow to control all the digital pin of the target(s), as input or output. More precisely, it can configure any digital pin as input, or as output, and read and write all digital pins for now.
